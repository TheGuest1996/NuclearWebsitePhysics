How do fission reactions of U-235 and Pu-239 differ in terms of neutron initiation, energy yield, and radioactive byproducts?
<br>
Comparison of Fission Reactions: U-235 vs Pu-239
<br>
Factor: Neutron initiation
Uranium-235 (U-235): Fissions best with thermal (slow) neutrons
Plutonium-239 (Pu-239): Fissions with both thermal and fast neutrons
<br>
Factor: Spontaneous fission rate
U-235: Very low
Pu-239: Much higher — increases risk of premature neutron release
<br>
Factor: Energy yield per fission
U-235: ~200 MeV
Pu-239: ~210 MeV (slightly higher)
<br>
Factor: Fission fragments
U-235: Common fragments like Cs-137, Sr-90, I-131
Pu-239: Similar fragments, often more neutron-rich
<br>
Factor: Actinide production
U-235: Minimal (mostly U-236)
Pu-239: Significant (e.g., Pu-240, Am-241, Cm-244)
<br>
Factor: Alpha emitter formation
U-235: Few
Pu-239: More, including long-lived transuranics
<br>
Factor: Long-lived waste
U-235: Less complex and less radiotoxic
Pu-239: More radiotoxic and heat-generating
<br>
Factor: Reactor suitability
U-235: Ideal for thermal reactors (e.g., PWRs, BWRs)
Pu-239: Suited for fast reactors and breeder designs
<br>
Factor: Weapon design
U-235: Easier to use; stable yield
Pu-239: More powerful, but harder to handle due to Pu-240 content
<br>
<br>
What role does U-238 play in nuclear reactors, and how does it lead to the formation of Pu-239?
<br>
Although U-238 is not fissile (not directly used in a nuclear chain reaction), it is a fertile component in producing nuclear energy. It is used to absorb neutrons to transform into Pu-239 (a fissile isotope capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction).

<br>


Consequences:
<br>
1. Decay heat
Even after shutdown, fission fragments continue to decay and release energy.
<br>
~6–7% of total reactor power can persist for hours after shutdown.
<br>
This "decay heat" is why cooling systems must operate even when the reactor is off (e.g., Fukushima incident).
<br>
<br>
2. Radiation damage
Neutrons can make surrounding materials (e.g., steel, coolant) radioactive, a process called neutron activation.
<br>
This adds to the long-term management of radioactive waste.
<br>
What are the mechanisms and consequences of radiation produced by unstable fission fragments in a typical nuclear reactor?
<br>
<br>
3. Biological hazards
<br>
Fission fragments like xenon-135 and samarium-149 are strong neutron absorbers ("poisons").
<br>
They temporarily reduce reactivity and must be accounted for in reactor control.
