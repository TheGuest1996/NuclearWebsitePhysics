        What are the major risks and benefits associated with nuclear energy use in modern society, and how do these influence energy policy?
        <br>
        Benefits:
Nuclear energy itself does not emit carbon dioxide and other pollutants/GHGs
<br>
Risks:
Radioactive waste disposal and storage
Non-renewable
Water-intensive (used for cooling and turning steam turbines)
<br>
<br>
How do sociocultural and political attitudes toward nuclear energy differ across countries, and what factors shape these perspectives (including legal views)?
<br>
Historical Experience with Nuclear Events
Germany  Anti-nuclear stance
Deeply affected by Chernobyl (1986) and Fukushima (2011).

Led to strong public opposition and a political movement that pushed the Energiewende (energy transition).

Result: Decision to phase out all nuclear power, despite climate concerns.
<br>
<br>

France  Pro-nuclear tradition
Adopted nuclear early after the 1970s oil crisis to ensure energy independence.

~70% of electricity comes from nuclear.

Nuclear is seen as a source of national pride and low-carbon energy.

<br>
<br>
Japan  Mixed to anti-nuclear since 2011
Public support dropped sharply after Fukushima.

Nuclear restarts since then have been controversial and slow.

The legacy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki also shapes cultural sensitivity to radiation.
